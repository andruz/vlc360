this is a glovepie script i made, in order to control the VLC Media Player with the 360 controller.

i made this with personal purposes then i found it was very useful and i wanted to share it.

### INSTRUCTIONS ###

to use it you have to download Glovepie from here (its freeware)
http://carl.kenner.googlepages.com/glovepie_download

then open the xVLC 360 script with glovepie (avalible in this page, in "downloads")

then press "RUN" in Glovepie.

if the 360 controller is plugged in, this should work :)

make sure that VLC Media Player haves all the hotkeys by default.
